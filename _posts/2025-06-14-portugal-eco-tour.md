Tourists can now explore nature trails with smart wearables that suggest rest spots, detect terrain risks, and alert emergency services automatically. Public transport networks in Lisbon are also now AI-optimized for carbon reduction.

💡 **Travel Tip**: Carry a solar foldable charger when exploring Portugal’s coastlines.

⚠️ **Warning**: Avoid renting non-licensed electric scooters — many are unregulated.
