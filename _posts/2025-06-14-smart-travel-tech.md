Smart luggage with GPS and built-in chargers ensures you never lose your bags or power. Travel apps now suggest itineraries based on your habits and voice commands. AI-driven translators break language barriers instantly, and smart tags protect your belongings from theft.

💡 **Travel Tip**: Invest in a smart power bank with solar charging for off-grid adventures.

⚠️ **Warning**: Avoid using public USB charging ports — they pose a risk of data theft.
