Fridges now scan expiry dates and suggest meals. Some even reorder groceries automatically. Touchless faucets and smart spice racks are also trending in eco-conscious homes.

💡 **Tech Tip**: Sync your kitchen assistant with your health tracker for meal suggestions.

⚠️ **Warning**: Don’t place voice-controlled devices near noisy appliances — it may cause misfires.
